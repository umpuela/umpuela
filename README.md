# Hi, there!

I'm Sofia. I have a bachelor's degree in Applied Foreign Languages at the University of Brasilia. It was a this time when I had my first contact with digital accessibility and the tech field.
Since then, I’ve been diving deeper into data science through a postgraduate program in Data Analytics at FIAP.

## About me
